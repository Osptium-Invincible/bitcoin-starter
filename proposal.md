## About Me
- Name: Gokul Bansal
- University: IIT Jodhpur
- GitHub: https://github.com/Osptium-Invincible
- Languages: C++, Python
- Interests: Bitcoin internals, protocol-level engineering, open-source development

## Motivation
(Write 3–4 sentences about why you want to work on Bitcoin and what you hope to learn/achieve.)

## Proof of Work
- First open-source PR: (add link here)
- bitcoin-starter repo: https://github.com/Osptium-Invincible/bitcoin-starter
- Block header parser (Python) — parsed Block #170 and added results to NOTES.md

## Project Ideas / Areas of Interest
- Compact block relay / mempool tooling
- Block/transaction parsing and visualizers
- Wallet interoperability / testing tools

## Proposed Plan (high-level)
- Month 1: Read codebase, contribute small docs/tests, implement small parser improvements
- Month 2: Implement core feature, add tests, iterate with maintainers
- Month 3: Finalize, document, and propose integration/PR

## Timeline (to be detailed once a project is chosen)
- Milestone 1 (2 weeks): onboarding + 3 small PRs
- Milestone 2 (4 weeks): core implementation + tests
- Milestone 3 (remaining): polish, docs, handover
